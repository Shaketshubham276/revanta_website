                <p>
                Revanta Supermileage was started in the year 2009 as a result of the dream of a group of students who wanted to break the barriers of mileage. The team is being guided by Dr. KDP Singh (Mech. Dept) and Dr. Madhu Singh (Elect. Dept). Within a year of its inception, it participated in two International events, namely- SAE Supermileage-2010, held in Michigan, USA and Shell Eco Marathon Asia- 2011 and 2012, successively held in Kualalumpur, Malaysia. Both of these were under the Gasoline category.
